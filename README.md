# RAG-Techniques
---
This project aims at presenting common use-cases of RAG systems supported by codes. So far, the repo contains the following ***RAG*** techniques.
1. **[Adaptive Retrieval](https://github.com/sulaiman-shamasna/RAG-Techniques/blob/main/adaptive_retrieval.py)**: A retrieval method that dynamically adjusts its strategies or parameters based on the context or input query, improving performance by adapting to the evolving needs of the task or user.
2. **[Contextual Compression](https://github.com/sulaiman-shamasna/RAG-Techniques/blob/main/contextual_compression.ipynb)**: This technique reduces the size of the input context by distilling or summarizing key information, enabling more efficient retrieval and processing while retaining essential details for accurate response generation.
3. **[Document Augmentation](https://github.com/sulaiman-shamasna/RAG-Techniques/blob/main/document_augmentation.py)**: This technique enriches retrieved documents by appending additional context or data from external sources, improving the quality and relevance of information fed to the model during generation.
4. **[Explainable Retrieval](https://github.com/sulaiman-shamasna/RAG-Techniques/blob/main/explainable_retrieval.py)**: A retrieval technique focused on transparency, where the system provides clear explanations for why specific documents were retrieved, increasing trust and understanding in the retrieval process.
5. **[Fusion Retrieval](https://github.com/sulaiman-shamasna/RAG-Techniques/blob/main/fusion_retrieval.py)**: A method that combines multiple retrieval techniques or models to aggregate and integrate information from diverse sources, resulting in a more comprehensive and accurate final response.
6. **[Graph RAG](https://github.com/sulaiman-shamasna/RAG-Techniques/blob/main/graph_rag.py)**: This approach leverages graph-based structures to model relationships between retrieved documents or data points, allowing for more sophisticated reasoning and contextual understanding in the retrieval and generation process.
7. **[Hierarchical Indices](https://github.com/sulaiman-shamasna/RAG-Techniques/blob/main/hierarchical_indices.py)**: A retrieval approach that organizes documents or data in a multi-level structure, allowing for more efficient and targeted searches by narrowing down relevant information through progressively refined layers of indexing.
8. **[Query Transformation](https://github.com/sulaiman-shamasna/RAG-Techniques/blob/main/query_transformation.py)**: A technique that rewrites or reformulates the input query to improve retrieval performance, optimizing the search for relevant documents by making the query more effective for the underlying retrieval system.
9. **[Self-RAG](https://github.com/sulaiman-shamasna/RAG-Techniques/blob/main/self_rag.ipynb)**: A method where the system autonomously retrieves and processes relevant documents during generation without external prompts, enabling more seamless integration of retrieval into the response creation process.
