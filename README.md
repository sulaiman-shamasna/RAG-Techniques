# RAG-Techniques
---
This project aims at presenting common use-cases of RAG systems supported by codes. So far, the repo contains the following ***RAG*** techniques.
1. **[Adaptive Retrieval](https://github.com/sulaiman-shamasna/RAG-Techniques/blob/main/adaptive_retrieval.py)**:
1. **[Document Augmentation](https://github.com/sulaiman-shamasna/RAG-Techniques/blob/main/document_augmentation.py)**: This technique enriches retrieved documents by appending additional context or data from external sources, improving the quality and relevance of information fed to the model during generation.
2. **[Explainable Retrieval](https://github.com/sulaiman-shamasna/RAG-Techniques/blob/main/explainable_retrieval.py)**: A retrieval technique focused on transparency, where the system provides clear explanations for why specific documents were retrieved, increasing trust and understanding in the retrieval process.
3. **[Fusion Retrieval](https://github.com/sulaiman-shamasna/RAG-Techniques/blob/main/fusion_retrieval.py)**: A method that combines multiple retrieval techniques or models to aggregate and integrate information from diverse sources, resulting in a more comprehensive and accurate final response.
4. **[Graph RAG](https://github.com/sulaiman-shamasna/RAG-Techniques/blob/main/graph_rag.py)**: This approach leverages graph-based structures to model relationships between retrieved documents or data points, allowing for more sophisticated reasoning and contextual understanding in the retrieval and generation process.
5. **[Query Transformation](https://github.com/sulaiman-shamasna/RAG-Techniques/blob/main/query_transformation.py)**: A technique that rewrites or reformulates the input query to improve retrieval performance, optimizing the search for relevant documents by making the query more effective for the underlying retrieval system.
6. **[Self-RAG](https://github.com/sulaiman-shamasna/RAG-Techniques/blob/main/self_rag.ipynb)**:
